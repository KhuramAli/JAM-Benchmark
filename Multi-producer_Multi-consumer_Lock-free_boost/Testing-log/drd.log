==8777== 
==8777==     Valgrind's memory management: out of memory:
==8777==        newSuperblock's request for 201330688 bytes failed.
==8777==        2,831,958,016 bytes have already been mmap-ed ANONYMOUS.
==8777==     Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.
==8777== 
==8777==     There are several possible reasons for this.
==8777==     - You have some kind of memory limit in place.  Look at the
==8777==       output of 'ulimit -a'.  Is there a limit on the size of
==8777==       virtual memory or address space?
==8777==     - You have run out of swap space.
==8777==     - Valgrind has a bug.  If you think this is the case or you are
==8777==     not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==8777==     Please note that programs can take substantially more memory than
==8777==     normal when running under Valgrind tools, eg. up to twice or
==8777==     more, depending on the tool.  On a 64-bit machine, Valgrind
==8777==     should be able to make use of up 32GB memory.  On a 32-bit
==8777==     machine, Valgrind should be able to use all the memory available
==8777==     to a single process, up to 4GB if that's how you have your
==8777==     kernel configured.  Most 32-bit Linux setups allow a maximum of
==8777==     3GB per process.
==8777== 
==8777==     Whatever the reason, Valgrind cannot continue.  Sorry.
